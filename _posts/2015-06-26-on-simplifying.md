    description: "We probably don't need to remind you about the merits of melted cheese (right? The gooeyness. The gooeyness!). We think it's the sunniest part of any cheese plate, the best layer on a tray of nachos, a requisite on burgers. Heck, we even like cheese that has been melted, then cooled, then re-melted."

    description: 'Everyone in the U.S. has, at one point, taken a deep look at the gelatinous orange slice of "American cheese" and wondered: what exactly about this is "American"? The Tillamook brand, a farmer-owned dairy co-operative, is poking fun at the well-known grocery staple by launching an advertising and social media campaign to strip the infamous blazing orange cheese food of its "American" name.'

    description: "Friends, patriots, people who love a day off, Independence Day is coming and along with it a time to reflect on our feelings about all things American. Baseball, hamburgers, hip hop, apple pie, processed cheese dairy product... wait! If that last one didn't quite sound right, you're not alone."

description: 'We like to complicate things. Product launches, service offerings, websites, pizza... Why do we do this? Sometimes I think it stems from an idea that something needs to be complicated to hold more value. As in, an online course with 34 lessons and 197 bonuses must be more valuable than a course with just seven lessons.'
